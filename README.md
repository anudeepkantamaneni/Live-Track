# Live-Track
Pilot Health Monitoring Dashboard
Designed a real-time web system that tracks a pilot’s heart rate and stress levels using data from a smartwatch (like Garmin or Apple Watch). The system streams live biometric data to a secure dashboard accessible by the airline’s medical and operations team. Includes real-time alerts for abnormal readings, historical health analytics, and a responsive UI for control room use. Built for aviation safety and proactive health response.
