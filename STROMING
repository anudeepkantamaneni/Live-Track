In high-stakes aviation environments, a pilot’s health is critical. This system is designed to track a pilot’s heartbeat and stress levels in real time using a wearable smartwatch (such as Garmin or Apple Watch). The biometric data is streamed directly to a secure, web-based dashboard accessible to the airline’s operations or medical team.

The main goal is to ensure flight safety and pilot well-being by monitoring vitals like heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV), which indicate stress and fatigue. If the system detects unusual readings (like abnormally high heart rate), it can instantly trigger alerts, allowing ground personnel to respond proactively.

Key features include:

Live heart rate and stress level visualization

Secure login for authorized airline staff

Real-time alerts for abnormal health signals

Historical data storage for review and health analytics

Scalable web interface optimized for control rooms

This solution provides a new layer of safety and responsibility in aviation—a live health window into the cockpit, without ever interfering with the pilot's workflow.

 1. Smartwatch or Health Tracking Device
Best Option: Garmin or Apple Watch (with HealthKit API)

Garmin is highly accurate for heart rate and stress (HRV-based), with good developer API access.

Apple Watch offers excellent ecosystem integration and HealthKit API, great for medical-grade data.

✅ Garmin recommended for industrial/aviation use (rugged, long battery, accurate).

✅ 2. Stress Level Indicators to Track
Reliable and scientifically backed:

Heart Rate (HR) – Base metric, available on all wearables.

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) – Primary stress indicator.

ECG (Electrocardiogram) – For advanced tracking; supported by Apple Watch Series 4+.

Optional: Breathing rate or skin temperature.

🔹 Use HR + HRV for stress + fatigue detection.
🔹 Use ECG only if medically approved access is needed.

✅ 3. Who Will Access the Website
Recommended:

Airline Operations Team

Aviation Medical Officer (optional access)

Auto-alert systems with thresholds (e.g., heart rate > 120 bpm triggers alert)

🔐 Include role-based access control: Admin / Viewer / Medical.

✅ 4. Data Storage or Only Live Monitoring?
Suggested: Store data + show real-time

Store encrypted biometric data in a secure DB (PostgreSQL or Firebase).

Useful for:

Medical review

Pattern analysis

Safety audits

🔐 Use GDPR & HIPAA-compliant methods if dealing with health data.

✅ 5. Platform: Web Dashboard or Mobile App?
Recommended: Start with Web Dashboard

Easier to build, deploy, and monitor in control rooms.

Use responsive design (desktop + tablet views).

📱 Mobile App: Optional in Phase 2 (for pilots or mobile health access).

✅ 6. Tech Stack Recommendation
Frontend:

React.js + Tailwind CSS

Live charts: Recharts or Chart.js

Real-time data: Socket.IO or Firebase Realtime DB

Backend:

Node.js + Express

Database: Firebase Firestore or PostgreSQL

WebSocket or MQTT for a live data stream

Authentication: Firebase Auth or Auth0

Cloud Hosting: Vercel (Frontend) + Render or Google Cloud (Backend)
